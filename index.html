<h1>This friday CLAIMED <br>
we are going to the palisades to film the geological history of NYC
<br><h2>
The Palisades are among the most dramatic geologic features in the vicinity of New York City, forming a canyon of the Hudson north of George Washington Bridge, as well as providing a vista of the skyline.

Palisade is derived from the same root as word pale, ultimately from the Latin word palus, meaning stake. The Lenape called the cliffs "rocks that look like rows of trees", a phrase that became "Weehawken", the name of a town in New Jersey which sits at the top of the cliffs across from Manhattan.</h2></div>

<p>RoadMap for My Project about the Palisades:</b>

<p>Logistics of <a href="http://www.njpalisades.org/parkway.html">getting to the palisades</a>:</p>
There are a few things we could do I recommend we decide between these two options:
<ul>
	<li>

<p>Logistics of getting to the location to shoot:</p>
<br>
<p>Shot List:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoot of the class launching it (take off)</li>
<br>
<li>Left to Right pan of the NYC Skyline
   (leading into)
   right to left pan of the natural landscape </li>
<br>
<li>Begin the vertical decent down the palisades</li>
<br>
<li>Move along side of the mountain over the water panning briefly back to see the city   panorama at the level of the water (near the level of the water) then same as before pan back to the bottom of the palisades and then move vertical again and back to the landing shot of the class.</li>
<br></ul>

<h1>Post Production:</h1>
<br>
<p>Interviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interviewing artists who have been influenced by the palisades</li>
<br>
<li>interviewing geological researchers of the palisades to tell the story of the ancient life of manhattan</li><br>
<li>interviewing hikers who come to the palisades on weekends to escape manhattan and what it makes them think and feel</li><br>
</ul>

<p>Interactive Possibilities :</p>
<ul><li>
using the photos to create a 3D map of the pals aides that people can zoom into the geological formation below the water to see the enormous rock foundation of manhattan which is only this tiny little lump atop an enormous and ancient geological structure.  Web based or browser based (OR just an animation that goes into the final video).</li></ul></ul>
