<h1>This friday we are going to the palisades
<br><p>
The Palisades are among the most dramatic geologic features in the vicinity of New York City, forming a canyon of the Hudson north of George Washington Bridge, as well as providing a vista of the skyline.

Palisade is derived from the same root as word pale, ultimately from the Latin word palus, meaning stake. The Lenape called the cliffs "rocks that look like rows of trees", a phrase that became "Weehawken", the name of a town in New Jersey which sits at the top of the cliffs across from Manhattan.<p></div>

<h1>RoadMap:</h1>

<P>Travel logistics: route and information for <a href="http://www.njpalisades.org/parkway.html">getting to the palisades</a>: here is a plan for the class to consider (pending research tonight)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Map of the area 1.<a href="http://ameliawb.github.io/Roadmap/pipnjBrochureColor.pdf">LINK</a></li><br>
	<li>Map of the area 2.<a href="http://ameliawb.github.io/Roadmap/trailmapMiddle.pdf">LINK</a></li><br>
	<li>Map of the area 3.<a href="http://ameliawb.github.io/Roadmap/map.pdf">LINK</a></li><br></ul>

<h2>Getting to the location to shoot:</h2>
<p>Lets talk as a group and pick the best plan....</p>
<h2>Shot List:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shoot of the class launching it (take off)</li>
<br>
<li>Left to Right pan of the NYC Skyline
   (leading into)
   right to left pan of the natural landscape </li>
<br>
<li>Begin the vertical decent down the palisades</li>
<br>
<li>Move along side of the mountain over the water panning briefly back to see the city panorama at the level of the water (near the level of the water) then same as before pan back to the bottom of the palisades and then move vertical again and back to the landing shot of the class.</li>
<br>
<li>View of where the LG building will be in context with the landscape</li><br>
<li>[drawing of drone movement / story board]</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Post Production:</h1>
<h2>Interviews:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Artists who have been influenced by the palisades</li>
<br>
<li>Geological researchers / scholars of the palisades </li><br>
<li>hikers and nature lovers who come to the palisades on weekends to escape manhattan and what it makes them think and feel</li><br>
<li>Founders of the #StopLG movement leaders and politicians working to save the Palisades and prevent the large LG headquarters from being built atop the Palisades.</li><br>
<li>Leaders of <a href="http://www.protectthepalisades.org/">Protect the Palisades</a>.  From their website: <br><img src="http://ameliawb.github.io/Roadmap/beforewithafterLG.gif"></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Interactive Possibilities :</h2>
<p>
using the photos to create a 3D map of the pals aides that people can zoom into the geological formation below the water to see the enormous rock foundation of manhattan which is only this tiny little lump atop an enormous and ancient geological structure.  Web based or browser based (OR just an animation that goes into the final video).

<h1>More History:</h1>
<p>In the 1910s, when Fort Lee was a center of film production, the cliffs were frequently used as film locations. The most notable of these films wasThe Perils of Pauline, a serial which helped popularize the term cliffhanger.[14]

The Lenape called the cliffs "rocks that look like rows of trees", a phrase that became "Weehawken", the name of a town in New Jersey which sits at the top of the cliffs across from Manhattan.

The basalt cliffs are the margin of a diabase sill, formed about 200 million years ago[2] at the close of the Triassic Period by the intrusion of moltenmagma upward into sandstone.[3] The molten material cooled and solidified before reaching the surface. Water erosion of the softer sandstone left behind the columnar structure of harder rock that exists today. The cliffs are about 300 ft (100 m) thick in sections and originally may have reached to 1,000 ft (300 m).

During the 1800s, millions of cubic yards of Palisades basalt and diabase were extracted at the Englewood Cliffs quarry for railroad ballast and aggregate that helped to build New York City. A sandstone layer was also mined and used to construct many of the famous New York brownstone buildings.</p>
